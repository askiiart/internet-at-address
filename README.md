# Internet at an address

This is a collection of links to check what internet is available at an address.

## ISPs

Assume residential service unless otherwise noted.

- **[Mediacom Cable](https://shop.mediacomcable.com/) - if Mediacom isn't available at your address, it redirects you to a provider that is available**
<!-- I won't find the speeds and stuff for other providers, just Spectrum because I use it. I'm open to PRs adding details for other providers though. -->
- [Spectrum](https://www.spectrum.com/address/localization)
  - Plans (as of 2023-09-23):
    - 1 Gbps down, 35 Mbps up
    - 500 (600 for business) Mbps down, ~20 Mbps up (from personal testing) (35 Mbps for business)
    - 300 Mbps down, 10 Mbps up
  - [Upload speeds are only available for business plans](https://enterprise.spectrum.com/content/dam/spectrum/enterprise/en/pdfs/resources/product-briefs/SE-BI-PB001-Spectrum-Business-Internet.pdf) - 500's consumer upload speed comes from my own testing.
  - Has a student page, it doesn't actually have discounts.
- [AT&T](https://www.att.com/buy/broadband/availability.html)
  - To view plans without signing in, select new customer.

## Speedtests

### Sites

**Recommended sites in bold.**

- **[Cloudflare Speed Test](https://speed.cloudflare.com)** - Usually works great, but can occasionally show way above what you're actually getting. On rare occasions it won't ignore outliers, but it does 99% of the time.
- **[Fast](https://fast.com/)** - doesn't work with all my privacy stuff, but otherwise works well.
- [Meter.net](https://www.meter.net/) - Runs on various VPS providers, and allows specifying what server.
- [Google Fiber Speedtest](https://fiber.google.com/speedtest/) - Only HTTP works, and just tries to sell me Google Fiber when not in a private window?
- [Speedtest by Ookla](https://www.speedtest.net/) - Filled with ads, and not privacy-friendly, but it's very popular.
- [Xfinity Speedtest](https://speedtest.xfinity.com/) - open "show more" for more details.
